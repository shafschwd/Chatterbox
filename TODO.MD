Third Round: Practical Assessment Program
Successful candidates from the second round participate in a comprehensive 5-day
assessment program, which includes:
Day 1: Clickable Mock-Up Creation
Candidates are tasked with designing a clickable mock-up of a chatbox interface,
incorporating user account functionalities such as signup, login, and logout. They may utilize
tools such as PowerPoint, Figma, Justinmind, Adobe XD, Mockplus or other prototyping
software. This exercise evaluates their proficiency in user interface design and prototyping.
Day 2: Frontend Development
Building upon the previous day's work, candidates develop the frontend of the chatbox
using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This phase includes implementing user authentication
interfaces (signup, login, logout) and assesses their coding skills and ability to translate
design into functional interfaces.
Days 3 to 5: Backend Development with WebSockets
Over the final three days, candidates implement the backend functionality of the
chatbox, focusing on:
 User Authentication System: Developing secure signup, login, and logout
functionalities, ensuring user data is handled safely.
 Real-Time Communication: Utilizing WebSockets to enable real-time messaging
between users.
 Group Chat Feature: Implementing functionality that allows multiple users to
engage in group conversations, facilitating seamless group interactions.
 Data Management: Ensuring all messages and user interactions are stored in a
database for persistence and future retrieval.
This segment evaluates candidates' backend development capabilities, understanding of
real-time data transmission, database management skills, and their ability to implement
complex features like group chats.
Throughout this assessment program, candidates' performance is closely monitored to
ensure they meet the technical and collaborative standards required for the role.
